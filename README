CPAN::Changes::Group::Dependencies::Stats

This module is a utility tool that produces short, summarized details
about changes in dependencies between two sets of prerequisites such
that one can visually identify at a glance the general nature of the
dependency changes without being swamped by the specifics, only looking
into the specifics when the summary indicates it is warranted.

This aims to be a utility to assist downstream in quickly assessing
effort when performing manual updates.
